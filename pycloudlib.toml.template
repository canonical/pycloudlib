# Copy this file to ~/.config/pycloudlib.toml or /etc/pycloudlib.toml and
# fill in the values appropriately. You can also set a PYCLOUDLIB_CONFIG
# environment variable to point to the path of the config file.
#
# After you complete this file, DO NOT CHECK IT INTO VERSION CONTROL
# It you have a secret manager like lastpass, it should go there
#
# If a key is uncommented, it is required to launch an instance on that cloud.
# Commented keys aren't required, but allow further customization for
# settings in which the defaults don't work for you. If a key has a value,
# that represents the default for that cloud.
